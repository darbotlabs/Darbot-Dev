Darbot Dev is a Windows developer tool that integrates AI capabilities with the Darbot Labs Cyber-Retro Design System. It includes:

- **Explore interactive samples powered by local AI models with Darbot's cyber-retro design**
- **Browse, download, and run models from Hugging Face and GitHub**
- **View C# source code and export standalone Visual Studio projects with a single click**
- **Experience the Darbot Labs Cyber-Retro Design System in action**

## üöÄ Getting started
This is a research fork. For a stable experience, please use the [official Microsoft AI Dev Gallery from the Microsoft Store](http://aka.ms/ai-dev-gallery-store). To build this research version:

### 1. Set up the environment

>**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Darbot Dev requires [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later for building and Windows 10 or newer to run.
If you're new to building apps with WinUI and the Windows App SDK, follow the [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here).

**Required [Visual Studio components](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10#required-workloads-and-components):**
- Windows application development

### 2. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/darbotlabs/darbot-dev.git
```

### 3. Open AIDevGallery.sln with Visual Studio!

Ensure that the `AIDevGallery` project is set as the startup project in Visual Studio.

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run Darbot Dev!

>**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: On ARM64-based Copilot+ PCs, make sure to build and run the solution as `ARM64` (and not as `x64`). This is required especially when running the samples that invoke the Windows Copilot Runtime to communicate with models such as Phi Silica.

>**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Having issues installing the app on your machine? Let us know by <a href="https://github.com/darbotlabs/darbot-dev/issues">opening an issue </a> and our team will do our best to help!
